Dementia is a broad term used to describe a group of symptoms that over time affect a person's ability to think, remember, communicate, and perform daily activities. Dementia is not a specific disease, but rather a set of symptoms that can be caused by a variety of disorders or conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, vascular dementia, and others.

**Causes of Dementia?**

Dementia is caused by damage to nerve cells which affect brain function and can affect a person's cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, perception, and problem-solving skills. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, but there are several other conditions that can lead to the development of dementia, including vascular disease, Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal dementia.

**Common Symptoms:**

Some of the most common symptoms of dementia are included below along with some examples. The symptoms and course of dementia vary from person to person. Symptoms typically have a gradual onset and tend to worsen progressively over time, often spanning several years and can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life and the ability to care for themselves.
